<!-- Basic Rules
-----------------------------
Players: Typically two players.

Hand Signs: Players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

Rock: A fist.
Paper: An open hand.
Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.
Outcome: The outcome of the game is determined by three simple rules:

Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins).
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins).
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins).
Ties: If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and is usually played again to determine the winner.

How to Play
-----------------------------
Start the Game: Players usually say "Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot!" while moving their fists up and down in sync.
Reveal: On "shoot," both players reveal their chosen hand signs.
Determine the Winner: Use the basic rules to determine the winner of that round.
Repeat: Often, the game is played in a best-of-three format or until one player wins a predetermined number of rounds.
Variations
Extended Versions: Some variations include additional hand signs like Lizard and Spock, popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory":

Rock crushes Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors.
Scissors decapitates Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper.
Paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes Rock.
Team Play: The game can also be played in teams, where each team member competes against the opposing team member.

Complex Versions: Some cultures have their own versions with different hand signs and rules, such as Japanese "Janken."

Strategies
-----------------------------
Psychological Play: Trying to predict the opponentâ€™s next move based on their previous moves or body language.
Statistical Strategy: Utilizing common statistical patterns, such as people rarely playing the same move three times in a row.
Randomization: Using randomness to ensure unpredictability, making it difficult for the opponent to anticipate your next move.
Applications
Decision Making: Often used as a quick, impartial decision-making tool.
Competitive Play: There are actual tournaments and competitions based on Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Educational Tool: Helps in teaching probability, psychology, and game theory concepts.
